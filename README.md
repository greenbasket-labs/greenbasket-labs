## Hi, I’m Mohammed (Abdullahi) 👋

Smart Contract Developer & Security-Focused Auditor.

I design, implement, and review Solidity contracts with a security-first mindset — focused on correctness, invariants, and exploit resistance.

---

## 🔐 Core Focus

- Smart contract security & competitive audits
- Solidity-based protocol architecture
- Governance, staking & DeFi systems
- Test-driven development (Hardhat / Foundry)
- Edge-case & invariant modeling

---

## 🧱 Selected Work

- **Continuum Protocol** — non-custodial, time-based digital asset inheritance architecture  
- **Casper Governance Voting** — on-chain governance system  
- **Zama FHE Smart Contracts** — privacy-preserving contract patterns in Solidity  

---

## 🛡 Security & Audits

- **Code4rena – Rujira Audit (Dec 16, 2025 – Jan 16, 2026)**  
  Contributed to competitive audit covering Ghost Lending, Ghost Credit, and vault logic on THORChain (CosmWasm / Rust).  
  Focus areas: liquidation safety, LTV invariants, access control, debt accounting.

- Ongoing participation in public audits and Web3 bug bounties (Solidity / Rust).
