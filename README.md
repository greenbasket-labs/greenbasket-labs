## Hi, I’m Mohammed (Abdullahi) 👋  
Smart Contract Developer & Security-Focused Auditor

Backend-leaning blockchain developer focused on secure smart contract architecture, 
protocol design, and governance systems.

---

## Core Focus
- 🔐 Smart contract security & audit participation
- 🧱 Protocol-level contract architecture
- 🗳️ Governance & staking systems
- ⚙️ Solidity development with Hardhat / Foundry

---

## Selected Work
- 🧱 **Continuum Protocol** — non-custodial, time-based digital asset inheritance architecture
- 🗳️ **Casper Governance Voting** — on-chain governance system design
- 🔐 **Zama FHE Smart Contracts** — privacy-preserving contract patterns (research)
- 🧪 **SP1 zkVM Learning** — documented zero-knowledge experimentation

---

## Security & Audits
- 🛡️ **Code4rena – Rujira Audit (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026)**  
  Contributed to competitive audit covering Ghost Lending, Ghost Credit, and vault logic  
  on THORChain (CosmWasm / Rust).  
  Focus areas: liquidation safety, LTV invariants, access control, debt accounting.

- 🔍 Active participation in public audits and Web3 bug bounties (Solidity / Rust).

---

## Technical Stack
- **Languages:** Solidity, Rust
- **Tooling:** Hardhat, Foundry, GitHub Actions
- **Domains:** DeFi, governance systems, protocol security
- **Practices:** invariant thinking, edge-case analysis, test-driven development

---

## Current Direction (2026)
Building audit depth while developing secure, minimal smart contract systems.  
Focused on correctness, security guarantees, and protocol-level design.
