## Hi, I’m Musbahu 👋

Backend-leaning blockchain developer focused on protocol design,
on-chain governance, and zero-knowledge infrastructure.

## What I’m building
- 🧱 Protocol-level blockchain systems (Continuum Protocol)
- 🗳️ On-chain governance & voting systems
- 🔐 Zero-knowledge & privacy infrastructure (SP1 zkVM, ZK research)

## Status
Early-stage research & prototyping.  
No production deployments yet.

## Current focus (2026)
- Backend & protocol blockchain engineering
- Zero-knowledge infrastructure (zkVMs, SP1)
- Open-source work, hackathons, and grants

## Selected work
- 🧱 **Continuum Protocol** — protocol architecture & inheritance research
- 🗳️ **Casper Governance Voting** — on-chain governance system
- 🔐 **Zama FHE Smart Contracts** — privacy-preserving contract patterns
- 🧪 **Succinct SP1 zkVM Learning** — documented ZK learning journey

## Tech stack
- Solidity, Rust (learning)
- Smart contract & protocol design
- Zero-knowledge systems (zkVM concepts)
- GitHub, Remix, protocol research

📍 Open to: Backend / Protocol / Solidity roles
