## Hi, I’m Musbahu 👋

Backend-leaning blockchain developer building governance, protocol, and zero-knowledge infrastructure.

### What I’m building
- 🧱 Protocol-level blockchain systems (Continuum Protocol)
- 🗳️ On-chain governance & voting (Casper, Solidity)
- 🔐 Zero-knowledge & privacy infrastructure (SP1 zkVM, ZK research)

### Current focus (2026)
- Protocol & backend blockchain engineering
- Zero-knowledge infrastructure (SP1, zkVMs)
- Open-source contributions, hackathons, and grants

### Selected work
- 🧱 **Continuum Protocol** – protocol-level blockchain architecture & research  
- 🗳️ **Casper Governance Voting** – on-chain governance & DAO voting system  
- 🔐 **Zama FHE Smart Contracts** – privacy-preserving smart contracts  
- 🧪 **Succinct SP1 zkVM Learning** – documented ZK infrastructure journey  

### Tech stack
- Solidity, Rust (learning)
- Smart contracts & protocol design
- Zero-knowledge systems (SP1, zkVM concepts)
- GitHub, Remix, protocol research

📍 Open to: Backend / Protocol / Solidity roles
