## Hi, I’m Abdullahi 👋

Backend-leaning blockchain developer focused on protocol design,  
on-chain governance, and zero-knowledge infrastructure.

## What I’m building
- 🧱 Protocol-level blockchain systems (Continuum Protocol)
- 🗳️ On-chain governance & voting systems
- 🔐 Zero-knowledge & privacy infrastructure (SP1 zkVM, ZK research)

## Status
Early-stage research & prototyping.  
No production deployments yet.

## Current focus (2026)
- Backend & protocol blockchain engineering
- Zero-knowledge infrastructure (zkVMs, SP1)
- Open-source work, audits, hackathons, and grants

## Selected work
- 🧱 **Continuum Protocol** — protocol architecture & inheritance research  
- 🗳️ **Casper Governance Voting** — on-chain governance system  
- 🔐 **Zama FHE Smart Contracts** — privacy-preserving contract patterns  
- 🧪 **Succinct SP1 zkVM Learning** — documented zero-knowledge learning journey  

## Security & Audits
- 🛡️ **Code4rena – Rujira Audit (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026)**  
  Participated in a competitive audit covering Ghost Lending, Ghost Credit, and vault logic on THORChain (CosmWasm / Rust).  
  Focus areas included liquidation safety, LTV invariants, access control, and debt accounting.

- 🔍 Ongoing participation in public audits and bug bounties (Rust / Solidity).

## Tech stack
- Solidity, Rust (actively learning & applying)
- Smart contract & protocol design
- Zero-knowledge systems (zkVM concepts)
- GitHub, Remix, protocol research

📍 Open to: Backend / Protocol / Solidity roles
